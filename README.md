# CREDIT-CARD-FRAUD-DETECTION

Welcome to this GitHub repository housing a machine learning project dedicated to identifying fraudulent credit card transactions. The project encompasses crucial steps such as preprocessing and normalizing transaction data, effectively handling class imbalance issues, and splitting the dataset into distinct training and testing sets. Leveraging classification algorithms like logistic regression or random forests, the model is trained to differentiate between fraudulent and genuine transactions. The project's evaluation metrics, including precision, recall, and F1-score, provide insights into the model's performance. Additionally, techniques such as oversampling or undersampling are explored to optimize results. This repository offers a detailed codebase and resources, serving as a practical guide for implementing a robust fraud detection model using Python and popular machine learning libraries.
